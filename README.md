# Paywaz Documentation Hub (Public Preview)

Welcome to the **Paywaz Documentation Hub**, the central resource for technical,
merchant, and architectural documentation related to the Paywaz ecosystem.

> **Important:**  
> Paywaz is currently operating in **semi-stealth mode**.  
> All documentation in this repository is a **public preview** intended for
> early integrators, partners, and candidates.  
> Certain systems, flows, and endpoints are intentionally generalized or
> placeholder-only until public API access is released.

## What Is Paywaz?

Paywaz is a zero-fee, crypto-native global payments platform built on
next-generation Web3 rails, featuring:

- **Zero-Fee Payment Processing**
- **High-Speed On-Chain Settlement (Solana Mainnet)**
- **Multi-Chain Support & Stablecoin Payments**
- **Non-Custodial Security**
- **Hedged Stablecoins (PZUSD, PZGBP, PZEUR, etc.)**
- **Merchant, Enterprise, and Workforce Solutions**

This repository documents the structure, concepts, flows, and tools developers
will use to integrate Paywaz as we progress toward public launch.
